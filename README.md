W6D4 - React and Websockets
===========================

- Live coding of an example React app with websockets

- Some ideas:
    - Chat app... with `ws`
    - Agario clone
    - Slitherio clone
    - Collaborative lyric editing (show highlighting, etc.)
        - can do kanye stuff
        - chance to show off some neat React stuff
            - ... hmm not a bad idea I guess
            - trigger audio via websockets?
